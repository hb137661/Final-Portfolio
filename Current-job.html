  <p class="p" >Currently I am working at Kriby Farms Inc. I take care of the pigs
    that are on the farm. I am a nursery manager, meaning that I will take care of
    the little piglets that come from the home farm. The home farm is where the sows
    are bred, they will stay in the gestation until they are ready to farrow. When
    they are ready to farrow they will be moved to a farrowing unit and they will be put into clean crates.  </p>





  <p class="p">  When the piglets are about 16 days old they will be weaned from their mothers,
     and sent to the nurseries for me to take care of. I will count the piglets from the wean
     and sort them into different pens evenly. I will make sure they have food and water and good
     housing so that they will not get sick. Piglets usually stay at the nurseries for about 50
     days and when they are ready to be moved to a finisher so that they can grow up and be bigger.</p>
<p class="p">If the pig is a pure line it will come back to the home farm to be bred and make more pure line piglets.
   Then the cycle repeats itself over and over.
  There will always be pigs to take care of all of the time. </p>
