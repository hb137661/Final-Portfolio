My current job</figcaption>
<p>I would consider my current job one of my hobbies. I am always there making money and taking care of the pigs so that they get big and heathy that way they can be sold.</p>

<figcaption>  <img class="img" src="../trap/images/2017-06/IMG_3259.JPG" alt="" >
  Shooting trap is fun</figcaption>

    <p>I have been shooting trap since my freshmen year in high school. It is a fun sport to play because it takes a lot of skill to be able to shoot the bird. </p>

<div class="div3">
<figcaption>  <img class="img" src="Images/gym.jfif" alt="" >
  I like to go to the gym</figcaption>
  <p>I have been going to the gym since I was in 8th grade. The gym is one of my hobbies because it is a big stress reliever and you are getting healthier every time you do it. </p>
</div>
<div class="div4">
  <figcaption>  <img class="img" src="Images/food.jfif" alt="">
I enjoy eating food</figcaption>
<p>Eating food is also one of my major hobbies. If I am not at work, at the gym, or shooting trap I am probably eating something. Food is good for you “EAT BIG GET BIG”</p>

<!-- <p>  Currently I work on a farm working with pigs. My job title is "Animal care worker". I am the nursery manager and mainly work with the piglets that are 16 days old up to 53 days old.
  Working at my current job is a good thing for me because I like hard work and it will keep me busy.</p> -->

<!-- <p> Shooting trap is one of my favorite things to do because it clears your mind when you are shooting.</p>
  <p>Working out at the gym is a big stress reliever because you tire yourself out and you stop thinking that much.
     It is also a good thing because you keep yourself in shape and you look good too.</p> -->
